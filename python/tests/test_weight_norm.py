COMPREHENSIVE WEIGHT NORMALIZATION TESTING
=========================================

This test suite evaluates weight normalization in MLX using two complementary approaches:

1. MATHEMATICAL PROPERTY TESTS:
   - Initialize PyTorch and MLX independently with same seeds
   - Allow natural differences in numeric values (expected in different frameworks)
   - Verify mathematical properties are preserved (more important than exact values)
   - Real-world usage pattern where models are built independently in each framework

2. WEIGHT TRANSFER TESTS:
   - Directly transfer weights between frameworks with proper transposition
   - Verify exact numeric equivalence can be achieved when needed
   - Important for model conversion workflows
   - Shows how to port PyTorch models to MLX with identical results

WHY TWO APPROACHES?
- Mathematical tests ensure the algorithms are fundamentally correct
- Weight transfer tests show how to achieve exact equivalence when required
- Users should understand that frameworks naturally produce different numeric results
  even when both implementations are mathematically correct
